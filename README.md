# AI Flappy Bird

A small project to test how a genetic algorithm (created with the help of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)) can be used to teach an AI to play Flappy Bird (written in [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/)).

I was originally inspired by [Code Bullet's cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSW-5m8lRMs) and used [these](https://blog.apptension.com/2018/06/27/tensorflow-js-machine-learning-and-flappy-bird-frontend-artificial-intelligence/) [resources](https://github.com/ssusnic/Machine-Learning-Flappy-Bird) along the way, [among others](https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack).

## How to run

-   clone repo
-   run `yarn`
-   run `yarn dev`
-   press `P` to toggle pause (game is paused by default)
-   press `E` to force evolution (same process that happens every time current generation dies out)
